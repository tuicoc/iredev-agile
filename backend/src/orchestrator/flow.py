Artifact chain
──────────────
Phase 1 — Sprint Zero (sprint_zero_planning):
  Step 1  – extract_product_vision         → product_vision               (VisionaryAgent)
  Step 2  – review_product_vision          → reviewed_product_vision      (HITL)
  Step 3  – build_elicitation_agenda       → elicitation_agenda_artifact  (AgendaAgent focus pass)
  Step 4  – review_elicitation_agenda      → reviewed_elicitation_agenda  (HITL)
  Step 5  – conduct_requirements_interview → interview_record             (InterviewerAgent)
  Step 6  – review_interview_record        → reviewed_interview_record    (HITL — approve-only)
  Step 7  – synthesise_requirement_list    → requirement_list             (DistillerAgent)
  Step 8  – review_requirement_list        → requirement_list_approved    (HITL)
  Step 9a – create_user_stories            → user_story_draft
  Step 9c – estimate_and_validate_stories  → analyst_estimation
  Step 9b – build_product_backlog          → product_backlog
  Step 10 – review_product_backlog         → product_backlog_approved     (HITL)

Phase 2 — Backlog Refinement (backlog_refinement):
  Step 1 – generate_acceptance_criteria   → validated_product_backlog
  Step 2 – review_validated_backlog       → validated_product_backlog_approved  (HITL)

Phase 3 — Sprint Execution (sprint_execution):
  Placeholder — steps added incrementally when Sprint N is implemented.

Phase 4 — Sprint Review (sprint_review):
  Placeholder.

SprintAgent pipeline (Steps 9a → 9c → 9b)
──────────────────────────────────────────
The product backlog is now built through a three-step collaboration between
SprintAgent (Product Owner) and AnalystAgent (Technical Lead):

  Step 9a — Story Creation (sprint_agent_turn):
    SprintAgent reads requirement_list_approved and converts each requirement
    into a user story ("As a … I can … so that …"). No estimation at this stage.
    Output: user_story_draft artifact.

  Step 9c — Technical Estimation & Validation (analyst_estimation_turn):
    AnalystAgent reads user_story_draft and performs:
      Pass 1 — Feasibility + INVEST assessment + dependency mapping.
               Stories > 8 points are flagged with split_proposals.
      Pass 2 — Fibonacci estimation (sole source of story_points in pipeline).
    If split_proposals exist, SprintAgent creates sub-stories and calls
    AnalystAgent again (max split_round = 2, tracked in state).
    Output: analyst_estimation artifact.

  Step 9b — WSJF Prioritization + Assembly (sprint_agent_turn):
    SprintAgent reads both user_story_draft and analyst_estimation, runs
    dependency-aware WSJF ranking, and assembles the final product_backlog.
    Output: product_backlog artifact with new consolidated schema.

AnalystAgent pipeline (Step 1, Phase 2)
────────────────────────────────────────
After product_backlog_approved, AnalystAgent runs a single AC-generation pass:
  Pass 3 — Given-When-Then Acceptance Criteria per PBI (2–5 per story).
  INVEST and estimation are already complete from Phase 1 — not repeated here.
  Output: validated_product_backlog artifact.

Supervisor routing

get_next_action() scans WORKFLOW_PHASES in order, returning the first step
whose prerequisites are met (all requires_artifacts present) but whose
output is absent (produces_artifact not yet in artifacts).
